It is designed to be fast, simple, and predictable:

* no dependencies

## What it does

* `tart` → shows the current week's log
* `tart "message"` → appends a task entry for today
* `tart --today` or `tart -t` → shows today's entries
* `tart --this-week` or `tart -tw` → shows current week
* `tart --week YYYY-Www` → shows a specific ISO week
